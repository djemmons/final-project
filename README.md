# final-project

### this is a basic layout of the xd file given in class for the final
 
### COMMENT: The white/black bar under the nav works on every other page besides home. I couldnt get it to stretch all the way to be across the whole screen.
 
### My fonts & the bigger message on contant also dont work. They do on my own page when I load it from my index but when I turn it in for some reason the fonts stop working.
